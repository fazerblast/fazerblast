## ⚠ . .╰・ ✦ : BOSLEY BOSEMAN / JEREMY ❕

! don't copy my skins. if my skin IS copied, i always have my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cloudbay?fan_landing=true) or github linked. !

- hi. im jeremy! i also go by bosley/bossman, but i really don't mind which is used (i also don't mind doubles)

- i dont really have a concrete dni, but if it counts; i hate dream fans, danganronpa fans and gross dsmp fans. gross dsmp fans as in sexualizing every single creator, and being hella sexist to the women on the smp.

- i have a partner system; im usually on with them if im not at docks. ask before frq and don't add me to party unless i boop you for a game/rp.

- hyperfixations; mlp, blueycapsules, fnaf, minecraft (NOT mcyt.), art

- don't cover me, i don't have a tt/td or anything it's just i really hate when i cant see my character. also dont get too close bc thats the same thing and i'll move away. i also don't like the kissing emote UNLESS you crown/compliment me and I do the kiss emote first.

- i use :3c as an emote very VERY often, if you think this is cringe you can suck my balls; but if it makes you uncomfortable (and we're in PARTY, or you're a FRIEND) ask me to stop using it and i will.

- i prefer tonetags but they aren't needed, just don't expect me to get you're joking when you say "kys" in a joking manner (which, i don't mind, but you NEED to specify if its a joke. unless you're a friend, then i will block you.)

- also don't?? call me stupid or anything? it makes me hella mad and i'll probably dip on you. unless you use tonetags or are a friend then this doesn't apply to you, but fr tho why the FUCK would you call a stranger stupid as a joke, w/o tonetags.
